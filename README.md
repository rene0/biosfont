biosfont
========

biosfont is a (toy) driver for FreeBSD. It enables user to read the bitmap tables which define the standard character set. These tables are stored in the BIOS memory. Currently the program runs on the i386 and amd64 architectures. Patches for other unices and architectures are welcome.

Availability
============
The program itself and some examples are available in the FreeBSD Ports Collection as sysutils/biosfont and misc/biosfont-demos
